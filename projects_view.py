"""The Projects tab: a JOIN of what already exists, nothing new captured.

The user's words: "we need in the dashboard the projects where you can click
into them to see more info about each project, the repo location, etc." Every
fact this module surfaces is already recorded somewhere else —
`session_watch.py` knows the conversations, `run_store.py` knows the runs,
`builds.py` knows the plan, `repo_read.py` knows the repository. This module
only joins them by project name and orders the result.

Two passes, deliberately split by cost:

  * `build_project_views` is the CHEAP join — sessions and runs already held
    in memory, plus one `os.path.isdir` per project. It is what backs the
    list on the left of the master-detail view, and every project on the
    machine can be joined on every poll without walking a single repository.
  * `repo_summary` / `build_summary` are the EXPENSIVE half — a bounded
    filesystem walk (`repo_read.overview`) and a plan-file read
    (`builds.plan_progress`) — computed only for the one project a user has
    actually clicked into, off the event loop.

Three honesty rules this module exists to uphold (see CLAUDE.md):

  1. A project with no runs is `runs: []`, never a run count coerced to 0 and
     drawn as a measurement.
  2. A project's directory can be gone by the time someone clicks it —
     `directory_exists` says so plainly rather than a detail pane rendering
     empty as though the project were merely quiet.
  3. JARVIS's own spawned runs are not the user's conversations. This module
     takes `sessions` as an argument rather than reading the roster itself,
     so the caller supplies `server._snapshot_or_empty()` — which already
     filters JARVIS's own run sessions out — not the raw snapshot.
