"""preflight existed, was tested, and was never called.

Its own docstring claimed it ran at startup. It did not -- which is why an
expired login reached the user as "my language systems are down" and nothing
else, four restarts running, while the one line naming the cause went
unwritten. These tests exist so it cannot quietly stop running again.
