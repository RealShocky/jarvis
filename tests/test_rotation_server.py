"""Server-side rotation: the swap happens at a pause, and never silently.

Two things are being pinned here. First, a generation is never replaced
without a trace: the outgoing brain is asked for its own handover, and if it
will not or cannot give one, the server writes a minimal entry itself and
rotates anyway. Second, the request for that handover runs with
origin="system", so the acting-tool gate refuses any write the brain might
attempt while answering it.

No test here spawns a real `claude`: the brain is a fake throughout.
