"""JARVIS can read the one repository he could not: his own.

The user, twice: "Jarvis how much info do you have about how you are built",
and "but couldn't you technically look at your own Jarvis repo".

He had `repo_overview`, `search_repo` and `read_file` and no idea that one of
the repositories on this machine was him. This wires his own source in as a
project those three answer to — and nothing more than those three, because
JARVIS reading his own code is the ask and JARVIS starting an unattended
Claude Code process that EDITS his own code while running on it is not.

These tests read the REAL repository, deliberately: the point is that it works
with nothing configured, on a fresh clone, on the user's other machine. What
they must never do is read a secret out of it, so the .env refusal is checked
against the real file rather than a fixture — a fixture is exactly how this
project has previously fooled itself into thinking a guard was live.
