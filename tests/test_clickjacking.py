"""OriginGuard's premise is that `Origin` proves which page made the request.

Framing breaks that premise without forging anything. A hostile page puts
`http://localhost:8340/dashboard` in an iframe, makes it invisible, lays its
own bait over the top, and waits for one click. The click lands on JARVIS's
own button, so the POST that follows is made *by JARVIS's own page*: it
carries `Origin: http://localhost:8340`, which is exactly the origin the
guard is built to admit. One click is `POST /api/restart`,
`POST /api/runs/{id}/retry`, or `DELETE /api/runs/{id}`.

The only defence is to refuse to be framed at all, and that has to be said
in a response header — `X-Frame-Options` for the browsers that still only
read that, `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` for the ones
that prefer the modern spelling. Both, on every response: a JSON body
framed with `<object>` is a framed response too, and the read endpoints are
the ones with the conversations in them.

`nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy` ride along in the same middleware. They are
cheap and they close two adjacent holes: a JSON response re-interpreted as
HTML, and a run id or project path leaking into an outbound `Referer`.

Deliberately NOT here: a full CSP. Verified against both source pages
(`frontend/index.html`, `frontend/dashboard.html`) and both built ones
(`frontend/dist/*.html`) — every script is an external `<script
type="module" src=...>`, every style an external stylesheet, and there is
not one `onclick=` between them, so `script-src 'self'` would in fact hold
today. It is still not added: it would only ever apply to the pages served
off the API port (in development the pages come from Vite, which sends none
of these headers), and it would fail closed and silently the first time
anyone inlined a script. `frame-ancestors` is the directive that is doing
security work here.
